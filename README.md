### Description

This is a Golang web server with built in logging, tracing, health check, and graceful shutdown.

It also includes a few demo applications, including:

  - An Excel / Spreadsheet application using [JExcel](https://bossanova.uk/jexcel/v2/)
  - A QR Code Generator using [Google Charts API](https://developers.google.com/chart)
  - An SVG drawing example taken from [The Go Programming Language](https://github.com/adonovan/gopl.io/blob/master/ch3/surface/main.go)
  - A 3D sphere example using [THREE.JS](https://threejs.org/) 



I've included all of the raw template / html / css in the actual server code (main.go), but you can find the raw files which can be used to generate the pages and templates within the js / css / templates sub-folders.
